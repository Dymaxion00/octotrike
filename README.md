# Trike

This is the very start of a python port of the Trike threat modeling tool.  What's here are currently architectural sketches, not running code, and will stay that way for some time.  Feel free to look if you want, but I won't be looking for outside contributions until the core architecture is settled and converted to real code.  For more information on the current Trike versions, go to http://octotrike.org.
